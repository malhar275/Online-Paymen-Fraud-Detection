# Online-Paymen-Fraud-Detection
Developed a fraud detection model using a Decision Tree Classifier 🌳 to identify fraudulent transactions 🕵️‍♀️ in a dataset of online payments 💸.

Utilized data visualization techniques such as line charts 📈, scatter plots 📊, violin plots 🎻, and pie charts 🥧 to gain insights into the distribution of transaction types 📊, amounts 💰, and other relevant features 🔍.

Preprocessed the data by transforming categorical features into numerical values 🔢 and splitting the data into training and test sets 🧪.

Achieved a high accuracy score on the test set 💯, demonstrating the effectiveness of the model in identifying fraudulent transactions 🕵️‍♀️.
